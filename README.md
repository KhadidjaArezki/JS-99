# JS-99

These are my Javascript solutions for the famous [99-problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) that have been translated to many programming languages.

## Warning

The code is not optimized for performance. The methods are NOT considered best practices by most JS developers. I am simply practicing problem solving in a way that is similar to main stream Functional Programming languages.

"""
The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity to practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.

Every function that you write should begin with a comment that describes the function in a declarative statement. Do not describe procedurally, what the function does, but write down a logical statement which includes the arguments of the function. You should also indicate the intended data types of the arguments and the allowed flow patterns.
